# Project 0 - *Simple Todo*

**SimpleTodo** is an Android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

I followed CodePath's YouTube video [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrT2tZ9JRrf6cHOlMkbmTMFt0RzpJiRGX) to develop this project.

This readme is based on CodePath's [template](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/android_university/readme_templates/project_0_readme.md?raw=true).

Submitted by: **Phillip Dang**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **view a list of todo items**
* [x] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [x] User's **list of items persisted** upon modification and and retrieved properly on app restart

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] User can **leave an item's edit text box blank** to remove an item

## Notes

When following CodePath's YouTube video playlist, there were some portions where the instructor's code did not work in newer Android Studio versions.
I successfully implemented similar solutions which worked during my testing.
